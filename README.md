# Amperfied Connect Modbus

Home Assistant integration for Amperfied Connect wallboxes using the local
Modbus TCP interface.

I started this project for my own Connect wallbox. The existing Heidelberg
integration already covered the basic registers, but I wanted the Eco mode,
the internal phase switch and the end of a charging session to work together
without several separate Home Assistant automations.

The integration is still young. Version `0.1.0` has been tested on a Connect
wallbox with register layout `2.0.4`.

## What it does

- reads charging state, power, current, energy and diagnostic values;
- controls the charge-current limit and charge enable;
- switches the wallbox between Eco and manual charging;
- selects one- or three-phase charging on wallboxes with an internal phase
  switch;
- provides a **Stop charging** button for the current session;
- restores charge enable after the vehicle is unplugged, ready for the next
  RFID-authorized session.

When Eco mode is switched off, the integration can automatically return to
three-phase charging. A phase change is checked after the switching time stored
in the wallbox. If the requested state was not reached, the command is repeated
once. It will not keep retrying in a loop.

The manual phase selector is unavailable while Eco mode is active because the
wallbox controls the phases itself in that mode.

## Stop charging and Remote Lock

The **Stop charging** button sets the charge-current command to zero. Once the
vehicle is unplugged, the previous current limit is restored automatically.

This is separate from **Remote Lock**. Remote Lock blocks the wallbox globally;
it does not release the charging cable. Depending on the vehicle, it may still
need to be unlocked before the cable can be removed.

## Installation with HACS

Until the integration is included in the default HACS list, add this repository
as a custom repository:

`https://github.com/DerHimbeerHugo/home-assistant-amperfied-connect-modbus`

Select **Integration** as the repository type, install **Amperfied Connect
Modbus**, restart Home Assistant and add the integration under **Settings ->
Devices & services**.

The wallbox accepts only one Modbus TCP connection. Do not run this integration
and another Modbus integration for the same wallbox at the same time.

## Options

The integration can be configured under **Settings -> Devices & services ->
Amperfied Connect Modbus -> Configure**.

Available options:

- polling interval;
- return to three phases when Eco mode is disabled;
- verify phase switching and retry once;
- restore charge enable after the vehicle is unplugged.

The three behavior options are enabled by default.

## Compatibility

Eco and phase-switch entities are added only when the corresponding Modbus
registers are available. The phase functions require Connect Solar / Solar Pro
hardware with the internal phase-switch contactor.

Register definitions are based on the official
[Modbus documentation for the Connect series](https://www.amperfied.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Documentation-Modbus-Register-Layout-connect-series-20250422.pdf).

If you use the integration with another Connect model or register-layout
version, feedback is welcome through the GitHub issue tracker.
